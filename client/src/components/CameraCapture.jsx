          The Future of Web Development in 2025
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As we move deeper into 2025, web development continues to evolve at an
          incredible pace. New frameworks, tools, and methodologies are
          reshaping how we build applications for the modern web.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Key Trends to Watch</h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The rise of AI-assisted development has transformed workflows across
          the industry. Developers now collaborate with intelligent systems that
          can generate boilerplate code, suggest optimizations, and even debug
          complex issues with minimal human intervention.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Edge computing continues to gain traction, with more processing moving
          closer to end users. This shift has led to dramatically improved
          performance for web applications, especially in regions with limited
          connectivity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          WebAssembly has finally reached mainstream adoption, enabling
          high-performance applications that were previously unthinkable in
          browser environments. From advanced video editing to complex 3D
          rendering, the boundaries between native and web applications continue
          to blur.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">
          What This Means For Developers
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The skillset required for web development has expanded significantly.
          Beyond traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript expertise, today's
          developers need at least a basic understanding of AI integration, edge
          deployment strategies, and cross-platform optimization techniques.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Despite these challenges, there's never been a more exciting time to
          work in web development. The tools at our disposal enable us to create
          experiences that were impossible just a few years ago.
